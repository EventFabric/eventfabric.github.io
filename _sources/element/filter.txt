Filter Element
==============

The filter element receives an event, runs some logic with it and emits
an event if the value of the output field *keep* is *true* otherwise it discards
the event.

The logic to decide if the event should continue or be dropped is done through
a visual language.

To start with a pre made filter expand the *Templates* section and select 
*Filter Templates* there you can find some pre made blocks to start filtering.
